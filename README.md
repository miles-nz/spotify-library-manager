# spotify-library-manager

A small local web app with a homepage listing Spotify library-management
functions. Currently available:

- **Liked Songs Sync** - keeps your Liked Songs in sync with the union of
  two playlists: reads both playlists, reads your current Liked Songs, adds
  what's missing, and removes liked tracks that are no longer in either
  playlist.
- **Duplicate Finder** - pick two or more playlists and find tracks that
  appear in more than one of them, with the date each copy was added, so
  you can select which playlist(s) to remove each duplicate from.
- **Track Search** - search Spotify's catalog and preview any track with
  the embedded player.
- **Playlist Filter** - pick one or more playlists and a condition (release
  year, popularity, explicit, artist name, or track name), and add every
  matching track to another playlist - an existing one or a brand new one.
  Flags tracks already in the destination, plus any that look like a
  different version (remaster, live, single edit, etc.) of a track already
  there.
- **Playlist Cleanup** - pick a playlist and a rule for what to keep (added
  date, release year, popularity, explicit, artist name, or track name);
  everything that doesn't match gets removed.

## Setup

1. Register a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard:
    - Click **Create app**.
    - Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` (must match exactly).
    - APIs used: **Web API**.
    - Save, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Settings.

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and
   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` (`SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` is already set to match
   the redirect URI above).

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Open http://127.0.0.1:8888/, log in with Spotify if prompted, then pick
    a function from the homepage. Each one follows the same pattern:
    configure it (pick playlist(s) and, where relevant, a condition - your
    choice is remembered in the browser, use **Edit** to change it later),
    then run it. Scanning your library can take a few minutes for large
    playlists, and shows a progress screen with a **Cancel** option. Once
    it finishes you get a preview of the changes (tracks to add/remove) -
    review it and select what you actually want, then apply to make the
    change in Spotify.
